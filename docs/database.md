# Database Connection Pool

## Overview

Fluxora Backend uses a `pg.Pool` (node-postgres) for all database access. The pool is configured via environment variables and includes proactive exhaustion detection to prevent unbounded request queuing.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | PostgreSQL connection string (required) |
| `DB_POOL_MIN` | `2` | Minimum idle connections kept alive |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | `10` | Maximum total connections |
| `DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` | `5000` | ms to wait for a connection before timing out |
| `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | ms before an idle connection is closed |
| `POOL_QUEUE_LIMIT` | `50` | Max requests allowed to queue before fast-failing with 503 |
| `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Per-connection statement timeout in ms. Set to `0` to disable. |

## Statement Timeout

### How it works

On every new physical connection, the pool's `connect` event fires `SET statement_timeout = $1` with the value of `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS`. This applies a session-level limit so any query that runs longer than the configured duration is automatically canceled by PostgreSQL with error code `57014` (`query_canceled`).

```
new connection established
       │
       ▼
SET statement_timeout = STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS
       │
       ▼
connection ready for queries
       │
       ▼
query exceeds timeout?
       │
      YES ──► PG error 57014 → QueryTimeoutError → HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout
       │
       NO
       │
       ▼
  result returned normally
```

### Disabling the timeout

Set `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS=0` to skip the `SET statement_timeout` call entirely. This is useful for long-running maintenance scripts or migrations that should not be interrupted.

### Error mapping

| PG error code | Error class | HTTP status |
|---|---|---|
| `57014` (query_canceled) | `QueryTimeoutError` | `504 Gateway Timeout` |

### Security note

Using a parameterized query (`SET statement_timeout = $1`) prevents SQL injection. The timeout value is validated as a non-negative integer by the `integerEnv` schema helper before it reaches the pool.

## Pool Exhaustion Detection

### How it works

When a query is submitted, the pool checks `pool.waitingCount` against `POOL_QUEUE_LIMIT` **before** attempting to acquire a connection. If the waiting queue has reached the limit, the request is rejected immediately with a `PoolExhaustedError` rather than queuing indefinitely.

```
incoming request
       │
       ▼
waitingCount >= POOL_QUEUE_LIMIT?
       │
      YES ──► PoolExhaustedError (503) + log pool_exhausted + increment counter
       │
       NO
       │
       ▼
  acquire connection → execute query
```

### Why queue-limit instead of total-count

Checking `waitingCount >= POOL_QUEUE_LIMIT` is more accurate than checking `totalCount >= max`. A full pool with zero waiting requests is healthy — all connections are actively serving queries. The queue length is the real saturation signal.

## Structured Logging

Every exhaustion event emits a structured `warn` log:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-28T13:00:00.000Z",
  "level": "warn",
  "message": "Postgres pool exhausted",
  "event": "pool_exhausted",
  "total": 10,
  "idle": 0,
  "waiting": 50,
  "queueLimit": 50
}
```

## Prometheus Metrics

Four metrics are exposed via the `/metrics` endpoint:

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `db_pool_active_connections` | Gauge | Checked-out (in-use) connections |
| `db_pool_idle_connections` | Gauge | Idle connections in the pool |
| `db_pool_waiting_requests` | Gauge | Requests waiting for a connection |
| `db_pool_exhausted_total` | Counter | Total requests rejected due to queue limit |

Gauges are updated on every `connect`, `acquire`, and `remove` pool event.

## Pool Events

| Event | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `connect` | New physical connection opened | Apply `statement_timeout`, sync gauges, debug log |
| `acquire` | Connection checked out | Sync gauges |
| `remove` | Connection closed/removed | Sync gauges, debug log |
| `error` | Idle client error | Error log |

## Caller Behaviour

`PoolExhaustedError` should be mapped to an HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` response. `QueryTimeoutError` should be mapped to an HTTP `504 Gateway Timeout` response. Both are handled automatically by the error handler in `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`.

## Operator Runbook

### Symptoms

- `db_pool_exhausted_total` counter is increasing
- `db_pool_waiting_requests` gauge is consistently at or near `POOL_QUEUE_LIMIT`
- API returning `503` responses on database-backed routes

### Triage steps

1. Check `db_pool_active_connections` — if it equals `DB_POOL_MAX`, the pool is fully saturated.
2. Check for slow queries: look for `"message": "Slow postgres query"` in logs.
3. Consider increasing `DB_POOL_MAX` if the database server can handle more connections.
4. Consider increasing `POOL_QUEUE_LIMIT` if bursts are short-lived and acceptable to queue.
5. Check for connection leaks: if `db_pool_active_connections` stays high after traffic drops, a caller may not be releasing connections.

### Partition Management

The `contract_events` table is partitioned by `happened_at` to ensure bounded growth. Partition management must be performed periodically to drop old data:
1. Ensure `dropOldPartitions` from `src/scripts/db-ops.ts` is scheduled via cron or a periodic job.
2. The function should be invoked with the retention period (e.g., 30 days).
3. The job must run with a database role that has permissions to execute `DROP TABLE`.
4. Validate that detached partitions are backed up per the existing S3 retention policy before actually dropping them.
5. Run the function in `dryRun = true` mode initially to audit partitions that will be dropped.

### Recommended alert thresholds

```yaml
# Alert when exhaustion events occur
- alert: DbPoolExhausted
  expr: increase(db_pool_exhausted_total[5m]) > 0
  severity: warning

# Alert when waiting queue is consistently high
- alert: DbPoolQueueHigh
  expr: db_pool_waiting_requests > 20
  for: 2m
  severity: warning
```
